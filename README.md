- ♿ **Accessible**: Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels
- 📱 **Responsive**: Seamless experience across all devices
- ⚡ **Performant**: Optimized assets, lazy loading, code splitting
- 🎨 **Aesthetic**: Glassmorphism with subtle purple accents
- 🎮 **Playful**: Easter eggs reward curious exploration
